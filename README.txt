### Caveats

Wireframe Child was built as a child theme for extending Wireframe Theme.

Various components & modules may use different licenses due to certain library dependencies. For example: [Wireframe Child](https://github.com/mixatheme/wireframe-child/) theme must be GPL-3.0+ because it uses Bootstrap, but [Wireframe Theme](https://github.com/mixatheme/wireframe-theme/) is still licensed under GPL-2.0 or greater.

### History

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) was released in the Summer of 2011. Around that same time, a client approached us for a new WordPress website with Bootstrap as a requirement. Our deadline was tight. So we hounded Github for a pre-existing theme. Our discovery led us to a few startup projects, but one project that caught our eye was a [Bootstrap 2 theme by Rachel Baker](https://github.com/rachelbaker/bootstrapwp-Twitter-Bootstrap-for-WordPress). We loved Rachel's theme and decided to build on top of it in late 2012.

As time went on, we refactored most of the code and eventually had time to build our own BS2/BS3 theme in 2013. We used it for our client projects for around 2 years. Thanks to [@rachelbaker](https://github.com/rachelbaker) for the inspiration!

Finally, we awaited the [GPL-compatible license switch with Bootstrap 3](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/2054) so we could release to the WordPress community between 2014-2015. Just when we were ready to publish our theme, we switched gears. In 2015 we decided to take an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) approach to building WordPress themes and heavily anticipated the release of Bootstrap 4. In late 2016, Wireframe 1.0.0-alpha was released.
